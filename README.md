# Finance App

Finance application for managing expenses. Built with Typescript and React. Currently working on front-end, will implement back-end server in the near future.

Credit to [Najla Sekariyanti](https://najlas.me) for the incredible UI/UX work on this app. Check out the wireframes [here](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/b7512e29-47ed-4f97-74f1-b958501c4539-c160/).

## Running the App

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone && cd finance-react
```

Then start the development server:

This launches a development server at `localhost:3000`. Visit this page on your browser to browse the app.
